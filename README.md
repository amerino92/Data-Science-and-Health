# Data-Science-and-Health


This project helped me to apply my knowledge in data science and I could merge it with the interesting field of Health. Here, I used and compared different approaches to solve this particular problem (detect if a patient is healthy or sick). Most of the techniques I used in this project I listed them below.

- Visualization and Dimension Reduction (PCA and T-SNE)
- Clustering Analysis (Agglomaritive and KMeans)
- Anomaly Detection (Elliptic Envelope and OneClassSVM)
- Imbalanced Classification (Random Under Sampling, Random Over Sampling and SMOTE)
- Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest)
